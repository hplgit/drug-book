   abstract:  This paper describes an extension of the so-called Rush-Larsen scheme, which is a widely used numerical method for solving dynamic models of cardiac cell electrophysiology. The proposed method applies a local linearization of non-linear terms in combination with the analytical solution of linear ordinary differential equations, to obtain a second order accurate numerical scheme. We compare the error and computational load of the second order scheme to the original Rush-Larsen method. For a given error tolerance, the second order method is from nine to 500 times faster than the original scheme, depending on the choice of model and tolerance.

   abstract:    Intracellular {C}a$^{2+}$ waves ({C}aWs) of cardiomyocytes are spontaneous 	events of {C}a$^{2+}$ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum that 	are regarded as an important substrate for triggered arrhythmias 	and delayed afterdepolarizations. However, little is known regarding 	whether or how {C}aWs within the heart actually produce arrhythmogenic 	membrane oscillation because of the lack of data confirming direct 	correlation between {C}aWs and membrane potentials (V(m)) in the heart. 	On the hypothesis that {C}aWs evoke arrhythmogenic oscillatory depolarization 	when they emerge synchronously and intensively in the heart, we conducted 	simultaneous fluorescence recording of intracellular {C}a$^{2+}$ ([{C}a$^{2+}$](i)) 	dynamics and V(m) of ventricular myocytes on subepicardial surfaces 	of Langendorff-perfused rat hearts using in situ dual-view, rapid-scanning 	confocal microscopy. In intact hearts loaded with fluo4/acetoxymethyl 	ester and RH237 under perfusion with cytochalasin D at room temperature, 	individual myocytes exhibited {C}a$^{2+}$ transients and action potentials 	uniformly on ventricular excitation, whereas low-K(+)-perfused (2.4 	mmol/L) hearts exhibited {C}aWs sporadically between {C}a$^{2+}$ transients 	without discernible membrane depolarization. Further [{C}a$^{2+}$](i) 	loading of the heart, produced by rapid pacing and addition of isoproterenol, 	evoked triggered activity and subsequent oscillatory V(m), which 	are caused by burst emergence of {C}aWs in individual myocytes. Such 	arrhythmogenic membrane oscillation was abolished by ryanodine or 	the Na(+)-{C}a$^{2+}$ exchanger inhibitor SEA0400, indicating an essential 	role of {C}aWs and resultant Na(+)-{C}a$^{2+}$ exchanger-mediated depolarization 	in triggered activity. In summary, we demonstrate a mechanistic link 	between intracellular {C}aWs and arrhythmogenic oscillatory depolarizations 	in the heart. Our findings provide a cellular perspective on abnormal 	[{C}a$^{2+}$](i) handling in the genesis of triggered arrhythmias in 	the heart.

   abstract:    In the current study, the three-dimensional (3D) topologies of dyadic 	clefts and associated membrane organelles were mapped in mouse ventricular 	myocardium using electron tomography. The morphological details and 	the distribution of membrane systems, including transverse tubules 	(T-tubules), junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and vicinal mitochondria, 	were determined and presumed to be crucial for controlling cardiac 	{C}a$^{2+}$ dynamics. The geometric complexity of T-tubules that varied 	in diameter with frequent branching was clarified. Dyadic clefts 	were intricately shaped and remarkably small (average 4.39x10(5) 	nm(3), median 2.81x10(5) nm(3)). Although a dyadic cleft of average 	size could hold maximum 43 ryanodine receptor (RyR) tetramers, more 	than one-third of clefts were smaller than the size that is able 	to package as many as 15 RyR tetramers. The dyadic clefts were also 	adjacent to one another (average end-to-end distance to the nearest 	dyadic cleft, 19.9 nm) and were distributed irregularly along T-tubule 	branches. Electron-dense structures that linked membrane organelles 	were frequently observed between mitochondrial outer membranes and 	SR or T-tubules. We, thus, propose that the topology of dyadic clefts 	and the neighboring cellular micro-architecture are the major determinants 	of the local control of {C}a$^{2+}$ in the heart, including the establishment 	of the quantal nature of SR {C}a$^{2+}$ releases (e.g. {C}a$^{2+}$ sparks).

   abstract:    Abnormalities in calcium handling have been implicated as a significant 	source of electrical instability in heart failure (HF). While these 	abnormalities have been investigated extensively in isolated myocytes, 	how they manifest at the tissue level and trigger arrhythmias is 	not clear. We hypothesize that in HF, triggered activity (TA) is 	due to spontaneous calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum 	that occurs in an aggregate of myocardial cells (an SRC) and that 	peak SCR amplitude is what determines whether TA will occur. {C}alcium 	and voltage optical mapping was performed in ventricular wedge preparations 	from canines with and without tachycardia-induced HF. In HF, steady-state 	calcium transients have reduced amplitude [135 vs. 170 ratiometric 	units (RU), P < 0.05] and increased duration (252 vs. 229 s, P < 	0.05) compared with those of normal. Under control conditions and 	during beta-adrenergic stimulation, TA was more frequent in HF (53\% 	and 93\%, respectively) compared with normal (0\% and 55\%, respectively, 	P < 0.025). The mechanism of arrhythmias was SCRs, leading to delayed 	afterdepolarization-mediated triggered beats. Interestingly, the 	rate of SCR rise was greater for events that triggered a beat (0.41 	RU/ms) compared with those that did not (0.18 RU/ms, P < 0.001). 	In contrast, there was no difference in SCR amplitude between the 	two groups. In conclusion, TA in HF tissue is associated with abnormal 	calcium regulation and mediated by the spontaneous release of calcium 	from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in aggregates of myocardial cells 	(i.e., an SCR), but importantly, it is the rate of SCR rise rather 	than amplitude that was associated with TA.

   abstract:    Although {C}a$^{2+}$ waves in cardiac myocytes are regarded as arrhythmogenic 	substrates, their properties in the heart in situ are poorly understood. 	On the hypothesis that {C}a$^{2+}$ waves in the heart behave diversely 	and some of them influence the cardiac function, we analyzed their 	incidence, propagation velocity, and intercellular propagation at 	the subepicardial myocardium of fluo 3-loaded rat whole hearts using 	real-time laser scanning confocal microscopy. We classified {C}a$^{2+}$ 	waves into 3 types. In intact regions showing homogeneous {C}a$^{2+}$ 	transients under sinus rhythm (2 mmol/L [{C}a$^{2+}$](o)), {C}a$^{2+}$ 	waves did not occur. Under quiescence, the waves occurred sporadically 	(3.8 waves. min(-1) x cell(-1)), with a velocity of 84 microm/s, 	a decline half-time (t(1/2)) of 0.16 seconds, and rare intercellular 	propagation (propagation ratio <0.06) (sporadic wave). In contrast, 	in presumably {C}a$^{2+}$-overloaded regions showing higher fluorescent 	intensity (113\% versus the intact regions), {C}a$^{2+}$ waves occurred 	at 28 waves x min(-1) x cell(-1) under quiescence with a higher velocity 	(116 microm/s), longer decline time (t(1/2) = 0.41 second), and occasional 	intercellular propagation (propagation ratio = 0.23) ({C}a$^{2+}$-overloaded 	wave). In regions with much higher fluorescent intensity (124\% versus 	the intact region), {C}a$^{2+}$ waves occurred with a high incidence 	(133 waves x min(-1) x cell(-1)) and little intercellular propagation 	(agonal wave). We conclude that the spatiotemporal properties of 	{C}a$^{2+}$ waves in the heart are diverse and modulated by the {C}a$^{2+}$-loading 	state. The sporadic waves would not affect cardiac function, but 	prevalent {C}a$^{2+}$-overloaded and agonal waves may induce contractile 	failure and arrhythmias.

   abstract:    1. Confocal laser scanning microscopy was used to visualize intercellular 	transmission of {C}a$^{2+}$ waves in intact rat ventricular trabeculae 	micro-injected with the calcium indicator fluo-3. 2. {C}a$^{2+}$ waves 	usually failed to be transmitted from cell to cell. At identified 	individual end-to-end cell contacts, successful transmission interspersed 	with failure, which sometimes occurred despite an apparent small 	spritz of {C}a$^{2+}$ between cells. The probability of cell to cell 	transmission (Ptran) was 0.13. 3. {C}a$^{2+}$ waves arose preferentially 	near junctions of connected cells, where connexin-43 was found, but 	randomly in enzymatically disconnected heart cells. 4. beta-Adrenergic 	stimulation significantly increased Ptran (to 0.22) and heptanol, 	an uncoupler of gap junction channels, significantly decreased it 	(to 0.045). 5. In regions of high [{C}a$^{2+}$]i due to damage, wave 	frequency decreased markedly with each cell-cell junction passed. 	6. The {C}a$^{2+}$ permeability of cardiac gap junctions may be regulated, 	and the low ability of cardiac gap junctions to transmit {C}a$^{2+}$ 	may help control the spread of {C}a$^{2+}$ from damaged regions.

   abstract:    During triggered propagated contractions, {C}a$^{2+}$ waves travel along 	cardiac trabeculae with a constant velocity (Vprop) ranging from 	0. 34 to 5.47 mm/s. To explore the determinants of Vprop, we studied 	(1) the relationship between [{C}a$^{2+}$]i and Vprop and (2) the effect 	of low concentrations of caffeine on Vprop. Trabeculae were dissected 	from the right ventricle of rat hearts. [{C}a$^{2+}$]i was measured 	using electrophoretically injected fura-2 and an image-intensified 	CCD camera. Force was measured using a silicon strain gauge, and 	sarcomere length was measured using laser diffraction techniques. 	After induction of reproducible {C}a$^{2+}$ waves by trains of electrical 	stimuli (2.5 Hz) at 21.9+/-0.2 degrees C, the number of stimuli or 	[{C}a$^{2+}$]o was varied in 9 trabeculae. In 5 trabeculae, the effects 	of caffeine (0.1 to 1.0 mmol/L) at [{C}a$^{2+}$]o of 2.2+/-0.3 mmol/L 	were determined. All images were recorded under stable conditions 	of wave propagation. The increment in [{C}a$^{2+}$]i during the last 	electrically stimulated transient (Delta{C}aT) and [{C}a$^{2+}$]i just 	before onset of the {C}a$^{2+}$ waves ({C}aD) were used to estimate the 	{C}a$^{2+}$ loading of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and the myoplasm, 	respectively. The ratio (Delta{C}aW/Delta{C}aT) of the [{C}a$^{2+}$]i increment 	during the waves (Delta{C}aW) to Delta{C}aT was used to estimate the 	probability of opening of the SR-{C}a$^{2+}$ release channel during 	wave propagation. As a result of an increase of the number of stimuli 	or [{C}a$^{2+}$]o, Vprop increased in proportion to (1) Delta{C}aT (r=0.82); 	(2) {C}aD (r=0.88); (3) Delta{C}aW (r=0.85); and (4) Delta{C}aW/Delta{C}aT 	(r=0.74). The addition of caffeine (</=0.3 mmol/L) increased Vprop 	for any Delta{C}aT and any Delta{C}aW, revealing an increased sensitivity 	of Vprop to Delta{C}aT and Delta{C}aW. In contrast, caffeine had little 	effect on the relationship between Vprop and {C}aD and no effect on 	that between Vprop and Delta{C}aW/Delta{C}aT. These results suggest that 	both the cellular {C}a$^{2+}$ loading and open probability of the SR-{C}a$^{2+}$ 	release channels determine the velocity of propagation of {C}a$^{2+}$ 	waves.
