pages = {128-135}, 
year = {2011}, 
doi = {10.1161/CIRCEP.110.959916}, 
abstract ={Background‚Äî Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is caused by mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) or calsequestrin (Casq2) and can be difficult to treat. The class Ic antiarrhythmic drug flecainide blocks RyR2 channels and prevents CPVT in mice and humans. It is not known whether other class I antiarrhythmic drugs also block RyR2 channels and to what extent RyR2 channel inhibition contributes to antiarrhythmic efficacy in CPVT.Methods and Results‚Äî We first measured the effect of all class I antiarrhythmic drugs marketed in the United States (quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide, lidocaine, mexiletine, flecainide, and propafenone) on single RyR2 channels incorporated into lipid bilayers. Only flecainide and propafenone inhibited RyR2 channels, with the S-enantiomer of propafenone having a significantly lower potency than R-propafenone or flecainide. In Casq2‚àí/‚àí myocytes, the propafenone enantiomers and flecainide significantly reduced arrhythmogenic Ca2+ waves at clinically relevant concentrations, whereas Na+ channel inhibitors without RyR2 blocking properties did not. In Casq2‚àí/‚àí mice, 5 mg/kg R-propafenone or 20 mg/kg S-propafenone prevented exercise-induced CPVT, whereas procainamide (20 mg/kg) or lidocaine (20 mg/kg) were ineffective (n=5 to 9 mice, P<0.05). QRS duration was not significantly different, indicating a similar degree of Na+ channel inhibition. Clinically, propafenone (900 mg/d) prevented ICD shocks in a 22-year-old CPVT patient who had been refractory to maximal standard drug therapy and bilateral stellate ganglionectomy.Conclusions‚Äî RyR2 cardiac Ca2+ release channel inhibition appears to determine efficacy of class I drugs for the prevention of CPVT in Casq2‚àí/‚àí mice. Propafenone may be an alternative to flecainide for CPVT patients symptomatic on Œ≤-blockers.},

abstract ={Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is the leading cause of sudden death, and the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) is emerging as an important focus in its pathogenesis. RyR2 mutations have been linked to VT and sudden death, but their precise impacts on channel function remain largely undefined and controversial. We have previously shown that several disease-linked RyR2 mutations in the C-terminal region enhance the sensitivity of the channel to activation by luminal Ca2+. Cells expressing these RyR2 mutants display an increased propensity for spontaneous Ca2+ release under conditions of store Ca2+ overload, a process we referred to as store overload‚Äìinduced Ca2+ release (SOICR). To determine whether common defects exist in disease-linked RyR2 mutations, we characterized 6 more RyR2 mutations from different regions of the channel. Stable inducible HEK293 cell lines expressing Q4201R and I4867M from the C-terminal region, S2246L and R2474S from the central region, and R176Q(T2504M) and L433P from the N-terminal region were generated. All of these cell lines display an enhanced propensity for SOICR. HL-1 cardiac cells transfected with disease-linked RyR2 mutations also exhibit increased SOICR activity. Single channel analyses reveal that disease-linked RyR2 mutations primarily increase the channel sensitivity to luminal, but not to cytosolic, Ca2+ activation. Moreover, the Ca2+ dependence of [3H]ryanodine binding to RyR2 wild type and mutants is similar. In contrast to previous reports, we found no evidence that disease-linked RyR2 mutations alter the FKBP12.6‚ÄìRyR2 interaction. Our data indicate that enhanced SOICR activity and luminal Ca2+ activation represent common defects of RyR2 mutations associated with VT and sudden death. A mechanistic model for CPVT/ARVD2 is proposed.},

title = {Activation and propagation of Ca(2+) release during excitation-contraction coupling in atrial myocytes},
abstract = {Fast two-dimensional confocal microscopy and the Ca(2+) indicator fluo-4 were used to study excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling in cat atrial myocytes which lack transverse tubules and contain both subsarcolemmal junctional (j-SR) and central nonjunctional (nj-SR) sarcoplasmic reticulum. Action potentials elicited by field stimulation induced transient increases of intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) that were highly inhomogeneous. Increases started at distinct subsarcolemmal release sites spaced approximately 2 microm apart. The amplitude and the latency of Ca(2+) release from these sites varied from beat to beat. Subsarcolemmal release fused to build a peripheral ring of elevated [Ca(2+)](i), which actively propagated to the center of the cells via Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release. Resting myocytes exhibited spontaneous Ca(2+) release events, including Ca(2+) sparks and local (microscopic) or global (macroscopic) [Ca(2+)](i) waves. The microscopic [Ca(2+)](i) waves propagated in a saltatory fashion along the sarcolemma ("coupled" Ca(2+) sparks) revealing the sequential activation of Ca(2+) release sites of the j-SR. Moreover, during global [Ca(2+)](i) waves, Ca(2+) release was evident from individual nj-SR sites. Ca(2+) release sites were arranged in a regular three-dimensional grid as deduced from the functional data and shown by immunostaining of ryanodine receptor Ca(2+) release channels. The longitudinal and transverse distances between individual Ca(2+) release sites were both approximately 2 microm. Furthermore, electron microscopy revealed a continuous sarcotubular network and one peripheral coupling of j-SR with the sarcolemma per sarcomere. The results demonstrate directly that, in cat atrial myocytes, the action potential-induced whole-cell [Ca(2+)](i) transient is the spatio-temporal summation of Ca(2+) release from subsarcolemmal and central sites. First, j-SR sites are activated in a stochastic fashion by the opening of voltage-dependent sarcolemmal Ca(2+) channels. Subsequently, nj-SR sites are activated by Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release propagating from the periphery.},

The proposed method applies a local linearization of non-linear  terms in combination with the analytical solution of linear ordinary differential equations, to obtain a second order accurate numerical scheme. We compare the error and computational load of the second order scheme to the original Rush-Larsen  method. For a given error tolerance, the second order method is from nine to 500 times  faster than the original scheme, depending on the choice of model and tolerance.},

	solution containing bovine-albumine and Dextran. The heart was loaded

	appeared spontaneously during cardiac rest or after trains of electrical
	stimuli. They were initiated preferentially in the center third of
	the cell and propagated to the cell borders, suggesting a relation
	between the cell nucleus and wave initiation. They were suppressed

	with the {C}a$^{2+}$ resting level. Propagation velocity within myocytes
	(40 to 180 microm/s) decreased with the resting {C}a$^{2+}$ level.
	Intercellular propagation was mostly confined to two or three cells

	block and facilitation of SCW's was occasionally observed. On average
	10 to 20\% of cells showed non-synchronized simultaneous SCW's within

  abstract = {The effect of sudden local fluctuations of the free sarcoplasmic [{C}a++]i
	in cardiac cells on calcium release and calcium uptake by the sarcoplasmic
	reticulum (SR) was calculated with the aid of a simplified model
	of SR calcium handling. The model was used to evaluate whether propagation
	of calcium transients and the range of propagation velocities observed
	experimentally (0.05-15 mm s(-1)) could be predicted. {C}alcium fluctuations
	propagate by virtue of focal calcium release from the SR, diffusion
	through the cytosol (which is modulated by binding to troponin and
	calmodulin and sequestration by the SR), and subsequently induce
	calcium release from adjacent release sites of the SR. The minimal
	and maximal velocities derived from the simulation were 0.09 and
	15 mm s(-1) respectively. The method of solution involved writing
	the diffusion equation as a difference equation in the spatial coordinates.
	Thus, coupled ordinary differential equations in time with banded
	coefficients were generated. The coupled equations were solved using
	Gear's sixth order predictor-corrector algorithm for stiff equations
	with reflective boundaries. The most important determinants of the
	velocity of propagation of the calcium waves were the diastolic [{C}a++]i,
	the rate of rise of the release, and the amount of calcium released
	from the SR. The results are consistent with the assumptions that
	calcium loading causes an increase in intracellular calcium and calcium
	in the SR, and an increase in the amount and rate of calcium released.
	These two effects combine to increase the propagation velocity at
	higher levels of calcium loading.},

	{C}a$^{2+}$ induced by "{C}a$^{2+}$ overload." Single ventricular myocytes
	from rat were loaded with the {C}a$^{2+}$-sensitive indicator fluo

	overload, the frequency of spontaneous {C}a$^{2+}$ sparks, which occur
	at the t tubule/SR junction, increased approximately 4-fold, whereas
	the spark amplitude and spatial size increased 4.1-and 1.7-fold,

	For slowly propagating {C}a$^{2+}$ waves, discrete {C}a$^{2+}$-release

	These {C}a$^{2+}$ sparks appeared to recruit other sparks along the

	calcium, called "calcium sparks," were detected in quiescent rat
	heart cells with a laser scanning confocal microscope and the fluorescent
	calcium indicator fluo-3. Estimates of calcium flux associated with
	the sparks suggest that calcium sparks result from spontaneous openings
	of single sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium-release channels, a
	finding supported by ryanodine-dependent changes of spark kinetics.
	At resting intracellular calcium concentrations, these SR calcium-release
	channels had a low rate of opening (approximately 0.0001 per second).
	An increase in the calcium content of the SR, however, was associated
	with a fourfold increase in opening rate and resulted in some sparks
	triggering propagating waves of increased intracellular calcium concentration.
	The calcium spark is the consequence of elementary events underlying
	excitation-contraction coupling and provides an explanation for both
	spontaneous and triggered changes in the intracellular calcium concentration
	in the mammalian heart.},

  abstract = {It has previously been observed that spontaneous contractions start
	in a region of damage of isolated right ventricular trabeculae of
	rat, propagate along the muscle, and induce triggered arrhythmias
	(Mulder, B.J.M., P.P. de Tombe, and H.E.D.J. ter Keurs. 1989. J.
	Gen. Physiol. 93:943-961). The present study was designed to analyze
	the mechanisms that lead to triggered propagated contractions (TPCs).
	TPCs were elicited in 29 trabeculae by stimulation with trains (2
	Hz; 15-s intervals) at varied number of stimuli (n), lowered temperature
	(19-21 degrees C), and varied [{C}a++]o (1.5-4 mM) in the superfusate.
	Length (SL) and shortening of sarcomeres in the muscle were measured
	at two sites using laser diffraction techniques; twitch force (Ft)
	was measured with a silicon strain gauge. Time between the last stimulus
	in the train and the onset of sarcomere shortening due to a TPC at
	a site close to the damaged end region (latency) and propagation
	velocity of the contraction (Vprop) were correlated with Ft. For
	10 trabeculae, TPCs were calculated to start in the end region itself
	586 +/- 28 ms (mean +/- 1 SEM) after the last stimulus of a train
	(n = 15; [{C}a++]o: 1.5 mM), i.e., at the end of or after the rapid
	release of the damaged end during twitch relaxation. When Ft was
	increased by increasing either SL prior to stimulation or the afterload
	during twitches, methods that do not affect intracellular calcium
	levels, latency decreased, but Vprop remained constant. No TPC occurred
	when Ft was less than 20\% of maximal Ft. Both increasing [{C}a++]o
	and n increased Ft to a maximum, increased Vprop progressively (maximum
	Vprop, 17 mm/s), but decreased latency. These observations suggest
	that initiation of TPCs depends on the force developed by the preceding
	twitch, and therefore on the degree of stretch and subsequent rapid
	release of damaged areas in the myocardium, while Vprop along the
	trabeculae is determined by intracellular calcium concentration.},

  abstract = {We have recently described that after contractions propagate through
	multicellular cardiac muscle preparations. These propagating contractions
	are triggered in damaged regions of rat right ventricular trabeculae
	during relaxation of electrically stimulated twitches. Propagation
	of triggered contractions has been attributed to calcium ions that
	diffuse along the preparation, causing calcium-induced calcium release
	from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in adjacent cells. In the present
	study we have investigated a possible role of the sarcolemma and
	delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) in the initiation and propagation
	of triggered propagated contractions (TPCs) in multicellular preparations.
	We studied whether 1) TPCs are accompanied by delayed sarcolemmal
	depolarizations, 2) such depolarizations mediate local contraction,
	and 3) an intact sarcolemma is required for propagation of contractions.
	TPCs that remained stable for prolonged periods of time could be
	induced by trains of 15 stimuli (2 Hz, 15-second intervals) at lowered
	temperature (19-21 degrees C) of the superfusing Krebs-Henseleit
	medium and a [{C}a$^{2+}$]o of 1.0-1.5 mM. Although TPCs could be induced
	at 38 degrees C and a [{C}a$^{2+}$]o of 3.0-4.0 mM, they disappeared
	within 10 minutes. Force was measured with a silicon strain gauge;
	length and shortening of sarcomeres were measured at two sites of
	the muscle using laser diffraction techniques. Membrane potential
	was measured with flexible microelectrodes. Saponin was used to selectively
	render the sarcolemma permeable to small ions and molecules. Propagation
	velocity of TPCs in intact trabeculae varied from 1.7 to 13.4 mm/sec
	at 19-21 degrees C. TPCs were accompanied by DADs that could reach
	threshold and induce triggered arrhythmias. Changes in latency, duration,
	and force of TPCs, induced by changing [{C}a$^{2+}$]o or the number
	of conditioning stimuli, were closely matched by changes in latency,
	duration, and amplitude of DADs; DADs consistently preceded TPCs,
	on average by 60 msec. Local heating of the muscle, by applying a
	current through an insulated platinum wire (diameter 100 microns)
	that touched the muscle, interrupted propagation of TPCs reversibly.
	DADs were, in the absence of a local contraction, still recorded
	distal to the heated site. In muscles that were treated with saponin
	and exposed to solutions approximating the intracellular milieu,
	spontaneously occurring local contractions that propagated in both
	directions (at velocities of 70-200 microns/sec) were elicited at
	a bathing calcium concentration of approximately 0.6 microM. Below
	this threshold, propagated contractions could be triggered by pressure
	ejection of a calcium-containing solution from a microelectrode positioned
	close to the trabecula.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	not clear. We hypothesize that in HF, triggered activity (TA) is
	due to spontaneous calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum
	that occurs in an aggregate of myocardial cells (an SRC) and that
	peak SCR amplitude is what determines whether TA will occur. {C}alcium

	calcium transients have reduced amplitude [135 vs. 170 ratiometric
	units (RU), P < 0.05] and increased duration (252 vs. 229 s, P <
	0.05) compared with those of normal. Under control conditions and
	during beta-adrenergic stimulation, TA was more frequent in HF (53\%
	and 93\%, respectively) compared with normal (0\% and 55\%, respectively,
	P < 0.025). The mechanism of arrhythmias was SCRs, leading to delayed

	RU/ms) compared with those that did not (0.18 RU/ms, P < 0.001).
	In contrast, there was no difference in SCR amplitude between the
	two groups. In conclusion, TA in HF tissue is associated with abnormal
	calcium regulation and mediated by the spontaneous release of calcium
	from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in aggregates of myocardial cells
	(i.e., an SCR), but importantly, it is the rate of SCR rise rather

  abstract = {During triggered propagated contractions, {C}a$^{2+}$ waves travel along
	cardiac trabeculae with a constant velocity (Vprop) ranging from
	0. 34 to 5.47 mm/s. To explore the determinants of Vprop, we studied
	(1) the relationship between [{C}a$^{2+}$]i and Vprop and (2) the effect
	of low concentrations of caffeine on Vprop. Trabeculae were dissected
	from the right ventricle of rat hearts. [{C}a$^{2+}$]i was measured
	using electrophoretically injected fura-2 and an image-intensified
	CCD camera. Force was measured using a silicon strain gauge, and
	sarcomere length was measured using laser diffraction techniques.
	After induction of reproducible {C}a$^{2+}$ waves by trains of electrical
	stimuli (2.5 Hz) at 21.9+/-0.2 degrees C, the number of stimuli or
	[{C}a$^{2+}$]o was varied in 9 trabeculae. In 5 trabeculae, the effects
	of caffeine (0.1 to 1.0 mmol/L) at [{C}a$^{2+}$]o of 2.2+/-0.3 mmol/L
	were determined. All images were recorded under stable conditions
	of wave propagation. The increment in [{C}a$^{2+}$]i during the last
	electrically stimulated transient (Delta{C}aT) and [{C}a$^{2+}$]i just
	before onset of the {C}a$^{2+}$ waves ({C}aD) were used to estimate the
	{C}a$^{2+}$ loading of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and the myoplasm,
	respectively. The ratio (Delta{C}aW/Delta{C}aT) of the [{C}a$^{2+}$]i increment
	during the waves (Delta{C}aW) to Delta{C}aT was used to estimate the
	probability of opening of the SR-{C}a$^{2+}$ release channel during
	wave propagation. As a result of an increase of the number of stimuli
	or [{C}a$^{2+}$]o, Vprop increased in proportion to (1) Delta{C}aT (r=0.82);
	(2) {C}aD (r=0.88); (3) Delta{C}aW (r=0.85); and (4) Delta{C}aW/Delta{C}aT
	(r=0.74). The addition of caffeine (</=0.3 mmol/L) increased Vprop
	for any Delta{C}aT and any Delta{C}aW, revealing an increased sensitivity
	of Vprop to Delta{C}aT and Delta{C}aW. In contrast, caffeine had little
	effect on the relationship between Vprop and {C}aD and no effect on
	that between Vprop and Delta{C}aW/Delta{C}aT. These results suggest that
	both the cellular {C}a$^{2+}$ loading and open probability of the SR-{C}a$^{2+}$
	release channels determine the velocity of propagation of {C}a$^{2+}$
	waves.},

	occur in a variety of disease conditions; however, their cellular
	mechanisms in tissue are not clear. We hypothesize that spontaneous
	calcium oscillations in the whole heart are due to calcium release
	from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and are facilitated by calcium diffusion
	through gap junctions. Optical mapping of cytoplasmic calcium from
	Langendorff perfused guinea pig hearts (n = 10) was performed using
	oxygenated Tyrode's solution (in mM): 140 NaCl, 0.7 MgCl, 4.5 KCl,
	5.5 dextrose, 5 HEPES, and 5.5 {C}aCl? (pH 7.45, 34∞C). Rapid pacing
	was used to induce diastolic calcium oscillations. In all preparations,
	pacing-induced multicellular diastolic calcium oscillations (m-SCR)
	occurred across most of the mapping field, at all pacing rates tested.
	Ryanodine (1 ?M) eliminated all m-SCR activity. Low-dose caffeine
	(1 mM) increased m-SCR amplitude (+10.4 ± 4.4\%, P < 0.05) and decreased
	m-SCR time-to-peak (-17.4 ± 6.7\%, P < 0.05) and its temporal synchronization
	(i.e., range) across the mapping field (-26.9 ± 17.1\%, P < 0.05).
	Surprisingly, carbenoxolone increased the amplitude of m-SCR activity
	(+14.8 ± 4.1\%, P < 0.05) and decreased m-SCR time-to-peak (-11.3
	± 9.6\%, P < 0.01) and its synchronization (-37.0 ± 19.1\%, P < 0.05),
	similar to caffeine. In isolated myocytes, carbenoxolone (50 ?M)
	had no effect on the frequency of aftercontractions, suggesting the
	effect of cell-to-cell uncoupling on m-SCR activity is tissue specific.
	Therefore, in the whole heart, overt m-SCR activity caused by calcium
	release from the SR can be induced over a broad range of pacing rates.
	Enhanced ryanodine receptor open probability and, surprisingly, decreased
	cell-to-cell coupling increased the amplitude and temporal synchronization
	of spontaneous calcium release in tissue.},

  abstract = {The synchronization of coupled oscillators plays an important role
	in many biological systems, including the heart. In heart diseases,
	cardiac myocytes can exhibit abnormal electrical oscillations, such
	as early afterdepolarizations (EADs), which are associated with lethal
	arrhythmias. A key unanswered question is how cellular EADs partially
	synchronize in tissue, as is required for them to propagate. Here,
	we present evidence, from computational simulations and experiments
	in isolated myocytes, that irregular EAD behavior is dynamical chaos.
	We then show in electrically homogeneous tissue models that chaotic
	EADs synchronize globally when the tissue is smaller than a critical
	size. However, when the tissue exceeds the critical size, electrotonic
	coupling can no longer globally synchronize EADs, resulting in regions
	of partial synchronization that shift in time and space. These regional
	partially synchronized EADs then form premature ventricular complexes
	that propagate into recovered tissue without EADs. This process creates
	multiple premature ventricular complexes that propagate as [corrected]
	"shifting" foci resembling polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Shifting
	foci encountering shifting repolarization gradients can also develop
	localized wave breaks leading to reentry and fibrillation. As predicted
	by the theory, rabbit hearts exposed to oxidative stress (H(2)O(2))
	exhibited multiple shifting foci causing polymorphic tachycardia
	and fibrillation. This mechanism explains how collective cellular
	behavior integrates at the tissue scale to generate lethal cardiac
	arrhythmias over a wide range of heart rates.},

	To address these points, we evoked SR {C}a$^{2+}$ release by rapid

	and measured caffeine-induced DADs (cDADs) with whole-cell current
	clamp. The SR {C}a$^{2+}$ load of the myocyte was varied by different

	of Delta[{C}a$^{2+}$](i) (simple exponential), and the Delta[{C}a$^{2+}$](i)
	threshold of 424+/-58 nmol/L was sufficient to trigger an AP. Blocking

	[Na](o) and [{C}a$^{2+}$](o) (or with 5 mmol/L {N}i$^{2+}$) reduced

	blockade of {C}a$^{2+}$-activated {C}l$^{-}$ current (I(Cl({C}a)))

	conclude that DADs are almost entirely due to I(Na/{C}a), not I(Cl({C}a))
	or {C}a$^{2+}$-activated nonselective cation current. To trigger
	an AP requires 30 to 40 micromol/L cytosolic {C}a$^{2+}$ or a [{C}a$^{2+}$](i)
	transient of 424 nmol/L. Current injection, simulating I(ti)s with
	different time courses, revealed that faster I:(ti)s require less
	charge for AP triggering. Given that spontaneous SR {C}a$^{2+}$ release
	occurs in waves, which are slower than cDADs or fast I(ti)s, the

	3-fold higher in normal myocytes. This provides a safety margin against

  abstract = {In cardiac tissue, reduced membrane excitability and reduced gap junction
	coupling both slow conduction velocity of the action potential. However,
	the ionic mechanisms of slow conduction for the two conditions are
	very different. We explored, using a multicellular theoretical fiber,
	the ionic mechanisms and functional role of the fast sodium current,
	INa, and the L-type calcium current, I{C}a(L), during conduction slowing
	for the two fiber conditions. A safety factor for conduction (SF)
	was formulated and computed for each condition. Reduced excitability
	caused a lower SF as conduction velocity decreased. In contrast,
	reduced gap junction coupling caused a paradoxical increase in SF
	as conduction velocity decreased. The opposite effect of the two
	conditions on SF was reflected in the minimum attainable conduction
	velocity before failure: decreased excitability could reduce velocity
	to only one third of control (from 54 to 17 cm/s) before failure
	occurred, whereas decreased coupling could reduce velocity to as
	low as 0.26 cm/s before block. Under normal conditions and conditions
	of reduced excitability, I{C}a(L) had a minimal effect on SF and on
	conduction. However, I{C}a(L) played a major role in sustaining conduction
	when intercellular coupling was reduced. This phenomenon demonstrates
	that structural, nonmembrane factors can cause a switch of intrinsic
	membrane processes that support conduction. High intracellular calcium
	concentration, [{C}a]i, lowered propagation safety and caused earlier
	block when intercellular coupling was reduced. [{C}a]i affected conduction
	via calcium-dependent inactivation of I{C}a(L). The increase of safety
	factor during reduced coupling suggests a major involvement of uncoupling
	in stable slow conduction in infarcted myocardium, making microreentry
	possible. Reliance on I{C}a(L) for this type of conduction suggests
	I{C}a(L) as a possible target for antiarrhythmic drug therapy.},

  abstract = {Triggered activity in cardiac muscle and intracellular {C}a$^{2+}$ have
	been linked in the past. However, today not only are there a number
	of cellular proteins that show clear {C}a$^{2+}$ dependence but also
	there are a number of arrhythmias whose mechanism appears to be linked
	to {C}a$^{2+}$-dependent processes. Thus we present a systematic review
	of the mechanisms of {C}a$^{2+}$ transport (forward excitation-contraction
	coupling) in the ventricular cell as well as what is known for other
	cardiac cell types. Second, we review the molecular nature of the
	proteins that are involved in this process as well as the functional
	consequences of both normal and abnormal {C}a$^{2+}$ cycling (e.g.,
	{C}a$^{2+}$ waves). Finally, we review what we understand to be the
	role of {C}a$^{2+}$ cycling in various forms of arrhythmias, that is,
	those associated with inherited mutations and those that are acquired
	and resulting from reentrant excitation and/or abnormal impulse generation
	(e.g., triggered activity). Further solving the nature of these intricate
	and dynamic interactions promises to be an important area of research
	for a better recognition and understanding of the nature of {C}a$^{2+}$
	and arrhythmias. Our solutions will provide a more complete understanding
	of the molecular basis for the targeted control of cellular calcium
	in the treatment and prevention of such.},

  abstract = {{C}a$^{2+}$ waves underlying triggered propagated contractions (TPCs)
	are initiated in damaged regions in cardiac muscle and cause arrhythmias.
	We studied {C}a$^{2+}$ waves underlying TPCs in rat cardiac trabeculae
	under experimental conditions that simulate the functional nonuniformity
	caused by local mechanical or ischemic local damage of myocardium.
	A mechanical discontinuity along the trabeculae was created by exposing
	the preparation to a small jet of solution with a composition that
	reduces excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) in myocytes within
	that segment. The jet solution contained either caffeine (5 mmol/L),
	2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM; 20 mmol/L), or low {C}a$^{2+}$ concentration
	([{C}a$^{2+}$]; 0.2 mmol/L). Force was measured with a silicon strain
	gauge and sarcomere length with laser diffraction techniques in 15
	trabeculae. Simultaneously, [{C}a$^{2+}$]i was measured locally using
	epifluorescence of Fura-2. The jet of solution was applied perpendicularly
	to a small muscle region (200 to 300 microm) at constant flow. When
	the jet contained caffeine, BDM, or low [{C}a$^{2+}$], during the stimulated
	twitch, muscle-twitch force decreased and the sarcomeres in the exposed
	segment were stretched by shortening normal regions outside the jet.
	Typical protocols for TPC induction (7.5 s-2.5 Hz stimulus trains
	at 23 degrees C; [{C}a$^{2+}$]o=2.0 mmol/L) reproducibly generated
	{C}a$^{2+}$ waves that arose from the border between shortening and
	stretched regions. Such {C}a$^{2+}$ waves started during force-relaxation
	of the last stimulated twitch of the train and propagated (0.2 to
	2.8 mm/sec) into segments both inside and outside of the jet. Arrhythmias,
	in the form of nondriven rhythmic activity, were induced when the
	amplitude of the {C}a$^{2+}$-wave was increased by raising [{C}a$^{2+}$]o.
	Arrhythmias disappeared rapidly when uniformity of ECC throughout
	the muscle was restored by turning the jet off. These results show,
	for the first time, that nonuniform ECC can cause {C}a$^{2+}$ waves
	underlying TPCs and suggest that {C}a$^{2+}$ dissociated from myofilaments
	plays an important role in the initiation of {C}a$^{2+}$ waves.},

	with the fundamental unit of excitation-contraction coupling, the

	ryanodine receptors in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane, we show
	how a network of couplons with 3 basic properties (random activation,
	refractoriness, and recruitment) produces the classic physiological
	properties of excitation-contraction coupling and, under pathophysiological
	conditions, leads to {C}a alternans and {C}a waves. Moving to the tissue

	with normal longitudinal conduction velocity (0.55 m/s), the numbers

	electrical remodeling. In conclusion, the source-sink mismatch in
	well-coupled cardiac tissue powerfully protects the heart from arrhythmias
	due to sporadic afterdepolarizations. Structural and electrophysiological

	1 connexin (also designated Cx43), mediates action potential propagation
	between cells in order to synchronize cardiac contraction. alpha
	1 connexin channels are concentrated in gap junction plaques located

	the docking of two hemi-channels, termed connexons, formed by a ring

	with an axial ratio of 4-5:1 with approximately 20 A extending into
	the extracellular gap approximately 50 A spanning the lipid bilayer
	and approximately 50 A extending into the cytoplasmic space. We have
	recently grown two-dimensional crystals of a recombinant C-terminal
	truncation mutant of alpha 1 connexin (designated alpha 1Cx263T)

	maps derived by electron cryocrystallography revealed that the intercellular
	channel is lined by six alpha-helices, and there is a second ring
	of six alpha-helices at the interface with the membrane lipids. These
	rings of alpha-helices are staggered by 30 degrees, which predicts
	that the two connexons in the channel are staggered by 30 degrees
	such that each connexin subunit in one connexon interacts with two
	subunits in the apposed connexon. Such a quaternary arrangement may
	confer stability in the docking of the connexons to form a tight
	electrical seal for intercellular current flow during cardiac conduction.},
