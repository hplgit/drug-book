\chapter[The burst mode]{The burst mode of the mutant sodium channel \label{burst_chap}}

We observed above that the effect of the $\Delta$KPQ mutation of the SCN5A
gene leading to a delayed sodium current can be modeled by increasing the
reaction rates from the inactivated state to the open state and to the
permissible state $C_{0}$. The model gave results at least qualitatively 
similar to the experimental data (see Figure \ref{NaM/mc.pdf}). 

A better-established way of
modeling the effect of the mutation is to introduce a so-called burst mode.
A simple Markov model including a burst mode is illustrated in Figure \ref{burst_prototype}, where the states of the burst mode
are indicated by $\ast$. Note that when the channel is in the burst mode,
there is no inactivated state and therefore the burst mode can be used to model the effect of impaired inactivation.
The reaction rates going from the burst mode to
the normal mode are given by $k^{u}$ (where $u$ stands for up) and the reaction rates from the normal mode
to the burst mode are given by $k^{d}$
(where $d$ stands for down). We assume $k^{d}<<k^{u}$, which means that, for the wild type, 
the probability of being in the burst mode is very small. The probability
of being in the burst mode increases with the mutation severity index $\mu$.
As usual, $\mu=1$ represents the wild type. In the wild type, a channel is basically never in the burst mode and therefore the channel inactivates as it should and no late sodium current is observed. In the mutant case, however, the probability of being in the burst mode is increased. Since there is no inactivated state in the burst mode, the channel fails to inactivate and therefore the probability of being in the open state is increased and therefore we observe a non-negligible late current. This will be illustrated in the numerical computations below.

\section{Equilibrium probabilities}

We will start by considering the equilibrium states of the prototypical
model illustrated in Figure \ref{burst_prototype}. By following the usual steps
(see, e.g., page \pageref{9001}) we find
\begin{comment}
The equilibrium solutions are characterized by
the system of equations%
\begin{align}
k_{io}i  &  =k_{oi}o,\text{ }k_{ci}c=k_{ic}i,\text{ }k_{co}c=k_{oc}o,\\
\mu k^{d}c  &  =k^{u}c^{\ast},\text{ }\mu k^{d}o=k^{u}o^{\ast}.
\end{align}
As usual, all variables can be expressed in terms of the open probability,%
\begin{equation}
i=\frac{k_{oi}}{k_{io}}o,\text{ }c=\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}o,\text{ }c^{\ast
}=\frac{\mu k^{d}}{k^{u}}\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}o,\text{ }o^{\ast}=\frac{\mu
k^{d}}{k^{u}}o,
\end{equation}
and, since $o+i+c+c^{\ast}+o^{\ast}=1,$ we have%
\begin{equation}
\left(  1+\frac{k_{oi}}{k_{io}}+\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}+\frac{\mu k^{d}}{k^{u}%
}\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}+\frac{\mu k^{d}}{k^{u}}\right)  o=1
\end{equation}
and therefore
\end{comment}
 the equilibrium probabilities given by%
\begin{align}
o  &  =\frac{1}{1+\frac{k_{oi}}{k_{io}}+\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}+\frac{\mu k^{d}%
}{k^{u}}\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}+\frac{\mu k^{d}}{k^{u}}},\\
i  &  =\frac{\frac{k_{oi}}{k_{io}}}{1+\frac{k_{oi}}{k_{io}}+\frac{k_{oc}%
}{k_{co}}+\frac{\mu k^{d}}{k^{u}}\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}+\frac{\mu k^{d}}{k^{u}%
}},\\
c  &  =\frac{\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}}{1+\frac{k_{oi}}{k_{io}}+\frac{k_{oc}%
}{k_{co}}+\frac{\mu k^{d}}{k^{u}}\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}+\frac{\mu k^{d}}{k^{u}%
}},\\
c^{\ast}  &  =\frac{\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}\frac{\mu k^{d}}{k^{u}}}%
{1+\frac{k_{oi}}{k_{io}}+\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}+\frac{\mu k^{d}}{k^{u}}%
\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}+\frac{\mu k^{d}}{k^{u}}},\\
o^{\ast}  &  =\frac{\frac{\mu k^{d}}{k^{u}}}{1+\frac{k_{oi}}{k_{io}}%
+\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}+\frac{\mu k^{d}}{k^{u}}\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}+\frac{\mu
k^{d}}{k^{u}}}.
\end{align}
Here, we observe that the equilibrium probability of being in the inactivated
state is clearly reduced as the mutation severity index is increased. This is
the effect we wanted, since inactivation is impaired in the
mutation and the effect is modeled by introducing a burst mode that lacks the
inactivated state. Second, we observe that the sum of the open probabilities
given by%
\begin{equation}
o+o^{\ast}=\frac{1+\mu\frac{k^{d}}{k^{u}}}{1+\frac{k_{oi}}{k_{io}}%
+\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}+\mu\frac{k^{d}}{k^{u}}\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}+\mu
\frac{k^{d}}{k^{u}}}%
\end{equation}
is an increasing function of $\mu;$ in fact,%
\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{d\mu}\left(  o+o^{\ast}\right)  =\frac{\frac{k^{d}}{k^{u}}%
\frac{k_{oi}}{k_{io}}}{\left(  1+\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}+\frac{k_{oi}}{k_{io}%
}+\mu\frac{k^{d}}{k^{u}}\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}+\mu\frac{k^{d}}{k^{u}}\right)
^{2}}>0.
\end{equation}
So the model has the two main properties we seek: The equilibrium
probability of being in the inactivated state is reduced and the open probability
is increased.

\bigskip

\section{The mean open time}

We observed above (see page \pageref{mot_many}) that the formula for the mean open time can also
be derived in the presence of several open states. If we generalize the
argument to also take into account the inactivated state, we find that the
mean open time of the Markov model illustrated in Figure \ref{burst_prototype} is given by%
\begin{equation}
\tau_{o,\mu}=\frac{\mu k^{d}+k^{u}}{\mu k^{d}k_{oc}+k^{u}\left(  k_{oc}%
+k_{oi}\right)  }%
\end{equation}
and, since%
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\tau_{o,\mu}}{d\mu}=\frac{k_{oi}k^{d}k^{u}}{\left(  k^{u}k_{oc}+k^{u}k_{oi}+\mu k_{oc}k^{d}\right)  ^{2}},
\end{equation}
the mean open time increases as a function of the mutation severity index.

%\K{zzz Skal man skifte slik fra $k_{oc}$ og $k_{oi}$ til $k_{co}$ og $k_{io}$
%n\r{a}r man deriverer?}

\label{burst_prototype_drg}%
\end{figure}


Our aim is now to define an open state drug that can repair both the
equilibrium open probability and the mean open time. The structure of the open
state blocker is given in Figure \ref{burst_prototype_drg} and the equilibrium total open probability is now
given by 
\begin{comment}
the following system of equations:%
\begin{align*}
k_{io}i  &  =k_{oi}o,\text{ }k_{ci}c=k_{ic}i,\text{ }k_{co}c=k_{oc}o,\text{
}k_{bo}b=k_{ob}o,\\
\mu k^{d}c  &  =k^{u}c^{\ast},\text{ }\mu k^{d}o=k^{u}o^{\ast},\text{ }%
k_{bo}b^{\ast}=k_{ob}o^{\ast}.
\end{align*}
Since%
\begin{equation*}
i=\frac{k_{oi}}{k_{io}}o,\text{ }c=\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}o,\text{ }c^{\ast
}=\frac{\mu k^{d}}{k^{u}}\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}o,\text{ }o^{\ast}=\frac{\mu
k^{d}}{k^{u}}o,\text{ }b=\frac{k_{ob}}{k_{bo}}o,\text{ }b^{\ast}=\frac{k_{ob}%
}{k_{bo}}\frac{\mu k^{d}}{k^{u}}o
\end{equation*}
and $o+i+c+c^{\ast}+o^{\ast}+b+b^{\ast}=1,$ 
we obtain the total open probability%
\end{comment}
\begin{equation}
\left(  o+o^{\ast}\right)  _{\mu,d}=\frac{1+\mu\frac{k^{d}}{k^{u}}}{1+\frac
{k_{oi}}{k_{io}}+\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}+\mu\frac{k^{d}}{k^{u}}\frac{k_{oc}%
}{k_{co}}+\mu\frac{k^{d}}{k^{u}}+\frac{k_{ob}}{k_{bo}}\left(  1+\frac{\mu
k^{d}}{k^{u}}\right)  }. \label{o300}%
\end{equation}
Furthermore, the mean open time is now given by%
\begin{equation}
\tau_{o,\mu,d}=\frac{\mu k^{d}+k^{u}}{\mu k^{d}\left(  k_{oc}+k_{ob}\right)
+k^{u}\left(  k_{oc}+k_{oi}+k_{ob}\right)  }, \label{mot300}%
\end{equation}
where the subscript $d$ is used to remind us that this concerns the case where
the theoretical drug has been applied.

\bigskip

The task at hand is now to tune the drug such that the equilibrium open
probability and the mean open time given by $\left(  \ref{o300}\right)  $ and
$\left(  \ref{mot300}\right)  $, respectively, are as close as possible to the equilibrium open
probability and the mean open time of the wild type. We regard the parameters
$k_{ob}$ and $k_{bo}$ as the unknowns and we want to solve the following
$2\times2$ system of equations:%
\begin{align}
\frac{1+\mu\frac{k^{d}}{k^{u}}}{1+\frac{k_{oi}}{k_{io}}+\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}%
}+\mu\frac{k^{d}}{k^{u}}\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}+\mu\frac{k^{d}}{k^{u}}%
+\frac{k_{ob}}{k_{bo}}\left(  1+\mu\frac{k^{d}}{k^{u}}\right)  }  &  =\frac
{1+\frac{k^{d}}{k^{u}}}{1+\frac{k_{oi}}{k_{io}}+\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}+\frac{k^{d}}{k^{u}}%
\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}+\frac{k^{d}}{k^{u}}},\label{dr300}\\
\frac{\mu k^{d}+k^{u}}{\mu k^{d}\left(  k_{oc}+k_{ob}\right)  +k^{u}\left(
k_{oc}+k_{oi}+k_{ob}\right)  }  &  =\frac{k^{d}+k^{u}}{k^{d}k_{oc}%
+k^{u}\left(  k_{oc}+k_{oi}\right)  }, \label{dr301}%
\end{align}
where the latter equation determines the on rate, $k_{ob},$ of the drug,%
\begin{equation}
k_{ob}=\left(  \mu-1\right)  \frac{k^{d}k^{u}k_{oi}}{\left(  k^{u}+\mu
k^{d}\right)  \left(  k^{u}+k^{d}\right)  }, \label{kob300}%
\end{equation}
and we note that, in the case of $\mu=1,$ the  drug is completely turned off,
which is reasonable. Since $k_{ob}$ is known, the off rate of the drug can be
computed by solving $\left(  \ref{dr300}\right).$ If we define%
\begin{equation}
A=\frac{k_{ob}}{k_{bo}},
\end{equation}
we find from $\left(  \ref{dr300}\right)$  
\begin{equation}
A=(\mu-1)\frac{k_{oi}}{k_{io}}  \frac{k^{u}k^{d}}{\left(  \mu k^{d}+k^{u}\right)  \left(  k^{d}%
+k^{u}\right)  \label{Akbo}}
\end{equation}
and then the off rate of the drug is given by%
\begin{equation}
k_{bo}=A^{-1}k_{ob}=k_{io} \label{kbo300}
\end{equation}
which is the same as we have in the prototypical model given in 
Figure \ref{MOT_mut_L/BICO_O.pdf}; see (\ref{mot_in_dr}) on page \pageref{mot_in_dr}.

The purpose of this section is to show how the burst mode can be used to represent impaired inactivation and how the theoretical drug derived above works. 

\subsection{Representation of the late sodium current using the burst mode model}

As discussed in Chapter \ref{simple_Na}, impaired inactivation leads to a late sodium current (see Figure \ref{NaM/mc.pdf}). Here, we will see that this effect can also be obtained using a Markov model of the form indicated in Figure \ref{burst_prototype}. In Figure \ref{NaB/current.pdf}, we repeat the computations reported in Figure \ref{NaM/mc.pdf}, using the Markov model of Figure \ref{burst_prototype}. The parameters used in this computation are given in Table \ref{tab:burst_ob}. We observe from Figure \ref{NaB/current.pdf} that $\mu=20$ seems to represent the late current of Figure \ref{NaM/mc.pdf} fairly well. 
 
 \subsection{The open state blocker repairs the effect of the mutation}

In Figure \ref{NaB/current.pdf}, we show the late current for the wild type, the mutant $\mu=20$, and the drug using the optimal open state blocker defined by (\ref{kob300}) and (\ref{kbo300}). We observe that the late current induced by the mutation is  repaired by the open state blocker. The statistics of the open probability density function (for the wild type, the mutant ($\mu=20$), and the mutant where the drug has been applied) are given in Table \ref{tab:burst_stat} and  
the corresponding probability density functions are shown in Figure \ref{NaB/ob.pdf}. Again we note that the open blocker repairs the main features of the solution.

The simulations are based on averages of 10,000 runs. As expected, the open blocker asymptotically repairs the late current. }

\section{A more sophisticated Markov model \label{sophisticated}}

The Markov model presented in Figure \ref{burst_prototype} above has a structure that is a bit simpler than
the Markov model commonly used to model the sodium channel. A more common structure is given in 
Figure \ref{wtreac330}. This is the model we studied in Chapter \ref{simple_Na}. When a burst mode is added to it, the Markov model obtains the form illustrated in Figure \ref{burst}.

To understand how the burst mode changes the properties of the model,
it is of interest to compute the equilibrium probabilities. 
%\begin{comment}
The equilibrium state of the model presented in Figure \ref{burst} is
characterized by the following system of equations:%
\begin{equation}%
\begin{array}
[c]{ccc}%
k_{ci}c_{0}=k_{ic}i, & k_{oi}o=k_{io}i, & k_{co}c_{0}=k_{oc}o,\\
3\beta c_{0}=\alpha c_{1}, & 2\alpha c_{2}=2\beta c_{1}, & 3\alpha c_{3}=\beta c_{2},\\
k^{u}o^{\ast}=\mu k^{d}o, & k^{u}c_{0}^{\ast}=\mu k^{d}c_{0}, & k^{u}%
c_{1}^{\ast}=\mu k^{d}c_{1},\\
k^{u}c_{2}^{\ast}=\mu k^{d}c_{2}, & k^{u}c_{3}^{\ast}=\mu k^{d}c_{3}. &
\end{array}
\label{ep1}
\end{equation}
It follows that%
\begin{align*}
i &  =\frac{k_{oi}}{k_{io}}o,\text{ }c_{0}=\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}o,\text{ }\\
c_{1} &  =\frac{3\beta}{\alpha}\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}o,\text{ }c_{2}%
=\frac{3\beta^{2}}{\alpha^{2}}\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}o,\text{ }c_{3}=\frac
{\beta^{3}}{\alpha^{3}}\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}o,\\
o^{\ast} &  =\mu\frac{k^{d}}{k^{u}}o,c_{0}^{\ast}=\mu\frac{k^{d}}{k^{u}}%
\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}o,c_{1}^{\ast}=\mu\frac{3\beta}{\alpha}\frac{k^{d}}%
{k^{u}}\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}o,\\
c_{2}^{\ast} &  =\mu\frac{3\beta^{2}}{\alpha^{2}}\frac{k^{d}}{k^{u}}%
\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}o,c_{3}^{\ast}=\mu\frac{\beta^{3}}{\alpha^{3}}\frac
{k^{d}}{k^{u}}\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}o
\end{align*}
and, since the sum of the probabilities equals one, we have%
%\end{comment}
\[
o\left(  \mu\right)  =\frac{1}{\frac{k_{oi}}{k_{io}}+\left(  1+\mu\frac{k^{d}%
}{k^{u}}\right)  \left(  1+\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}\left(  1+\beta/\alpha\right)
^{3}\right)  }
\]
and
\[
o\left(  \mu\right)  +o^{\ast}\left(  \mu\right)  =\frac{1+\mu\frac{k^{d}%
}{k^{u}}}{\frac{k_{oi}}{k_{io}}+\left(  1+\mu\frac{k^{d}}{k^{u}}\right)
\left(  1+\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}\left(  1+\beta/\alpha\right)  ^{3}\right)  }.%
\]
Therefore,
\[
\frac{d}{d\mu}\left(  o\left(  \mu\right)  +o^{\ast}\left(  \mu\right)
\right)  =\frac{\frac{k_{oi}}{k_{io}}\frac{k^{d}}{k^{u}}}{\left(  \frac
{k_{oi}}{k_{io}}+\left(  1+\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}\left(  1+\beta/\alpha\right)
^{3}\right)  \left(  1+\mu\frac{k^{d}}{k^{u}}\right)  \right)  ^{2}}>0,%
\]
so the total open probability increases as the mutation severity index
$\mu$ increases. This will lead to a sustained sodium current characteristic
of the mutation under consideration. 

It is also interesting to see how the mutation severity index changes the
probability of being in the normal or burst mode. To understand
this, we define $b$ and $b^{\ast}$ as the sum of the probabilities in the
normal and burst modes, respectively. By using the equilibrium probabilities
derived above, we obtain
\[
\frac{b^{\ast}}{b}=\frac{o^{\ast}+c_{0}^{\ast}+c_{1}^{\ast}+c_{2}^{\ast}%
+c_{3}^{\ast}}{o+c_{0}+c_{1}+c_{2}+c_{3}+i}=\mu\frac{k^{d}}{k^{u}}%
\frac{1+\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}\left(  1+\beta/\alpha\right)  ^{3}}%
{\frac{k_{oi}}{k_{io}}+1+\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}\left(  1+\beta/\alpha\right)
^{3}}%
\]
and thus the probability of being in the burst mode increases as the mutation
severity index increases.

\section[Theoretical drug for the burst mode model]{A theoretical drug for the
mutation represented by the burst mode}

 In the simplified Markov model presented in Figure \ref{burst_prototype} above, we saw
that an open blocker was able to repair the effect of the mutation.
Now the Markov model is extended (see Figure \ref{burst}), but it is reasonable to
believe that an open blocker is still the best alternative, since both the open
probability and the mean open time are affected by the mutation. We consider
the Markov model given in Figure \ref{burstdrg}, where an open blocker is added to both
the open states of the Markov model given in Figure \ref{burst}. 
\begin{comment}
The equilibrium state
of the Markov model given in Figure \ref{burstdrg} is characterized by%
\begin{equation}%
\begin{array}
[c]{ccc}%
k_{ci}c_{0}=k_{ic}i, & k_{oi}o=k_{io}i, & k_{co}c_{0}=k_{oc}o,\\
3\beta c_{0}=\alpha c_{1}, & 2\alpha c_{2}=2\beta c_{1}, & 3\alpha c_{3}=\beta
c_{2},\\
k^{u}o^{\ast}=\mu k^{d}o, & k^{u}c_{0}^{\ast}=\mu k^{d}c_{0}, & k^{u}%
c_{1}^{\ast}=\mu k^{d}c_{1},\\
k^{u}c_{2}^{\ast}=\mu k^{d}c_{2}, & k^{u}c_{3}^{\ast}=\mu k^{d}c_{3}, & \\
k_{ob}o=k_{bo}b, & k_{ob}o^{\ast}=k_{bo}b^{\ast}. &
\end{array}
\end{equation}
\end{comment}
By following our usual procedure, we find that%
\begin{comment}
\begin{align*}
i &  =\frac{k_{oi}}{k_{io}}o,\text{ }c_{0}=\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}o,\text{ }\\
c_{1} &  =\frac{3\beta}{\alpha}\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}o,\text{ }c_{2}%
=\frac{3\beta^{2}}{\alpha^{2}}\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}o,\text{ }c_{3}=\frac
{\beta^{3}}{\alpha^{3}}\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}o,\\
o^{\ast} &  =\mu\frac{k^{d}}{k^{u}}o,c_{0}^{\ast}=\mu\frac{k^{d}}{k^{u}}%
\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}o,c_{1}^{\ast}=\mu\frac{3\beta}{\alpha}\frac{k^{d}}%
{k^{u}}\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}o,\\
c_{2}^{\ast} &  =\mu\frac{3\beta^{2}}{\alpha^{2}}\frac{k^{d}}{k^{u}}%
\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}o,c_{3}^{\ast}=\mu\frac{\beta^{3}}{\alpha^{3}}\frac
{k^{d}}{k^{u}}\frac{k_{oc}}{k_{co}}o,\\
b &  =\frac{k_{ob}}{k_{bo}}o,b^{\ast}=\mu\frac{k_{ob}}{k_{bo}}\frac{k^{d}%
}{k^{u}}o,
\end{align*}
\newline and, since the sum of the probabilities equals one, we have
\end{comment}
\[
\left(  o+o^{\ast}\right)  _{\mu,d}=\frac{1+\mu\frac{k^{d}}{k^{u}}}%
{\frac{k_{ob}}{k_{bo}}\left(  1+\mu\frac{k^{d}}{k^{u}}\right)  +\frac{k_{oi}%
}{k_{io}}+\left(  1+\mu\frac{k^{d}}{k^{u}}\right)  \left(  1+\frac{k_{oc}%
}{k_{co}}\left(  1+\beta/\alpha\right)  ^{3}\right)  }.
\]
The associated mean open time is given by%
\begin{equation}
\tau_{o,\mu,d}=\frac{\mu k^{d}+k^{u}}{\mu k^{d}\left(  k_{oc}+k_{ob}\right)
+k^{u}\left(  k_{oc}+k_{oi}+k_{ob}\right)  }.
\end{equation}
We now want to tune the drug characterized by the two parameters $k_{ob}$
and $k_{bo}$ such that
\[
\left(  o+o^{\ast}\right)  _{\mu,d}\approx\left(  o+o^{\ast}\right)  _{wt}%
\]
and%
\[
\tau_{o,\mu,d}\approx\tau_{o,wt},%
\]
where the subscript {\it wt} denotes wild type values. As above, we have two equations
for the two unknowns  $k_{ob}$ and $k_{bo}$ and the solution is given by%
\begin{equation}
k_{ob}=\left(  \mu-1\right)  \frac{k^{d}k^{u}k_{oi}}{\left(  k^{u}+\mu
k^{d}\right)  \left(  k^{u}+k^{d}\right)  } \label{na_drug_ob}
\end{equation}
and%
\begin{equation}
k_{bo}=A^{-1}k_{ob},
\end{equation}
where%
\begin{equation}
A=\frac{k_{oi}}{k_{io}}k^{u}k^{d}\frac{\mu-1}{\left(  \mu k^{d}+k^{u}\right)
\left(  k^{d}+k^{u}\right)  }.
\end{equation}
So we obtain
\begin{equation}
k_{bo}=k_{io}. \label{na_drug_bo}
\end{equation}
We note that the formulas for the optimal open blocker for the Markov model
given in Figure \ref{burstdrg} are exactly the same as for the open blocker of the prototype Markov
model given in Figure \ref{burst_prototype_drg}.

the mutant case where the optimal open blocker is applied. The blocker repairs the effect of the mutation and the same effect is seen in Figure \ref{NaB/mc_d.pdf} where the currents are given; the open blocker removes the late sodium current.

\section{Notes \label{notesburst}}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The burst mode is discussed by Bennett et al. \cite{Bennett1995} and modeled
in the paper by Clancy and Rudy \cite{Clancy1999}.
\item The form of the model illustrated in Figure \ref{burst} is taken from Clancy and
Rudy \cite{Clancy1999}, but the functions and parameters of the model are not
taken from their paper.
\item As mentioned above, the introduction of a burst mode is a convenient way of modeling the effect of certain mutations. The notion that gating may enter various modes has been considerably extended and studied in the papers by Chakrapani et al. \cite{ Chakrapani2007a, Chakrapani2007b, Chakrapani2011} and by Ionescu et al. \cite{Ionescu2007}. In the recent paper by Siekmann et al \cite{Siekmann2014} the concept of modal gating is studied and a method for detecting mode changes based on single channel data is developed.
