The proposed method applies a local linearization of non-linear  terms in combination with the analytical solution of linear ordinary differential equations, to obtain a second order accurate numerical scheme. We compare the error and computational load of the second order scheme to the original Rush-Larsen  method. For a given error tolerance, the second order method is from nine to 500 times  faster than the original scheme, depending on the choice of model and tolerance.},

	events of {C}a$^{2+}$ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum that
	are regarded as an important substrate for triggered arrhythmias

	whether or how {C}aWs within the heart actually produce arrhythmogenic
	membrane oscillation because of the lack of data confirming direct
	correlation between {C}aWs and membrane potentials (V(m)) in the heart.
	On the hypothesis that {C}aWs evoke arrhythmogenic oscillatory depolarization
	when they emerge synchronously and intensively in the heart, we conducted
	simultaneous fluorescence recording of intracellular {C}a$^{2+}$ ([{C}a$^{2+}$](i))
	dynamics and V(m) of ventricular myocytes on subepicardial surfaces

	individual myocytes exhibited {C}a$^{2+}$ transients and action potentials
	uniformly on ventricular excitation, whereas low-K(+)-perfused (2.4
	mmol/L) hearts exhibited {C}aWs sporadically between {C}a$^{2+}$ transients
	without discernible membrane depolarization. Further [{C}a$^{2+}$](i)
	loading of the heart, produced by rapid pacing and addition of isoproterenol,
	evoked triggered activity and subsequent oscillatory V(m), which
	are caused by burst emergence of {C}aWs in individual myocytes. Such
	arrhythmogenic membrane oscillation was abolished by ryanodine or
	the Na(+)-{C}a$^{2+}$ exchanger inhibitor SEA0400, indicating an essential
	role of {C}aWs and resultant Na(+)-{C}a$^{2+}$ exchanger-mediated depolarization
	in triggered activity. In summary, we demonstrate a mechanistic link
	between intracellular {C}aWs and arrhythmogenic oscillatory depolarizations
	in the heart. Our findings provide a cellular perspective on abnormal

	were intricately shaped and remarkably small (average 4.39x10(5)

	size could hold maximum 43 ryanodine receptor (RyR) tetramers, more

	to package as many as 15 RyR tetramers. The dyadic clefts were also
	adjacent to one another (average end-to-end distance to the nearest

    abstract = {Abnormalities in calcium handling have been implicated as a significant
	source of electrical instability in heart failure (HF). While these
	abnormalities have been investigated extensively in isolated myocytes,
	how they manifest at the tissue level and trigger arrhythmias is
	not clear. We hypothesize that in HF, triggered activity (TA) is
	due to spontaneous calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum
	that occurs in an aggregate of myocardial cells (an SRC) and that
	peak SCR amplitude is what determines whether TA will occur. {C}alcium
	and voltage optical mapping was performed in ventricular wedge preparations
	from canines with and without tachycardia-induced HF. In HF, steady-state
	calcium transients have reduced amplitude [135 vs. 170 ratiometric
	units (RU), P < 0.05] and increased duration (252 vs. 229 s, P <
	0.05) compared with those of normal. Under control conditions and
	during beta-adrenergic stimulation, TA was more frequent in HF (53\%
	and 93\%, respectively) compared with normal (0\% and 55\%, respectively,
	P < 0.025). The mechanism of arrhythmias was SCRs, leading to delayed
	afterdepolarization-mediated triggered beats. Interestingly, the
	rate of SCR rise was greater for events that triggered a beat (0.41
	RU/ms) compared with those that did not (0.18 RU/ms, P < 0.001).
	In contrast, there was no difference in SCR amplitude between the
	two groups. In conclusion, TA in HF tissue is associated with abnormal
	calcium regulation and mediated by the spontaneous release of calcium
	from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in aggregates of myocardial cells
	(i.e., an SCR), but importantly, it is the rate of SCR rise rather
	than amplitude that was associated with TA.},

	On the hypothesis that {C}a$^{2+}$ waves in the heart behave diversely

	incidence, propagation velocity, and intercellular propagation at
	the subepicardial myocardium of fluo 3-loaded rat whole hearts using

	a decline half-time (t(1/2)) of 0.16 seconds, and rare intercellular
	propagation (propagation ratio <0.06) (sporadic wave). In contrast,
	in presumably {C}a$^{2+}$-overloaded regions showing higher fluorescent

	at 28 waves x min(-1) x cell(-1) under quiescence with a higher velocity

	wave). In regions with much higher fluorescent intensity (124\% versus
	the intact region), {C}a$^{2+}$ waves occurred with a high incidence
	(133 waves x min(-1) x cell(-1)) and little intercellular propagation
	(agonal wave). We conclude that the spatiotemporal properties of
	{C}a$^{2+}$ waves in the heart are diverse and modulated by the {C}a$^{2+}$-loading
	state. The sporadic waves would not affect cardiac function, but
	prevalent {C}a$^{2+}$-overloaded and agonal waves may induce contractile
	failure and arrhythmias.},

	usually failed to be transmitted from cell to cell. At identified

	with failure, which sometimes occurred despite an apparent small
	spritz of {C}a$^{2+}$ between cells. The probability of cell to cell
	transmission (Ptran) was 0.13. 3. {C}a$^{2+}$ waves arose preferentially
	near junctions of connected cells, where connexin-43 was found, but
	randomly in enzymatically disconnected heart cells. 4. beta-Adrenergic
	stimulation significantly increased Ptran (to 0.22) and heptanol,
	an uncoupler of gap junction channels, significantly decreased it
	(to 0.045). 5. In regions of high [{C}a$^{2+}$]i due to damage, wave
	frequency decreased markedly with each cell-cell junction passed.
	6. The {C}a$^{2+}$ permeability of cardiac gap junctions may be regulated,

	may help control the spread of {C}a$^{2+}$ from damaged regions.},

  journal = {Circ Res},

  pages = {1459--1468},
  number = {12},
    abstract = {During triggered propagated contractions, {C}a$^{2+}$ waves travel along
	cardiac trabeculae with a constant velocity (Vprop) ranging from
	0. 34 to 5.47 mm/s. To explore the determinants of Vprop, we studied
	(1) the relationship between [{C}a$^{2+}$]i and Vprop and (2) the effect
	of low concentrations of caffeine on Vprop. Trabeculae were dissected
	from the right ventricle of rat hearts. [{C}a$^{2+}$]i was measured
	using electrophoretically injected fura-2 and an image-intensified
	CCD camera. Force was measured using a silicon strain gauge, and
	sarcomere length was measured using laser diffraction techniques.
	After induction of reproducible {C}a$^{2+}$ waves by trains of electrical
	stimuli (2.5 Hz) at 21.9+/-0.2 degrees C, the number of stimuli or
	[{C}a$^{2+}$]o was varied in 9 trabeculae. In 5 trabeculae, the effects
	of caffeine (0.1 to 1.0 mmol/L) at [{C}a$^{2+}$]o of 2.2+/-0.3 mmol/L
	were determined. All images were recorded under stable conditions
	of wave propagation. The increment in [{C}a$^{2+}$]i during the last
	electrically stimulated transient (Delta{C}aT) and [{C}a$^{2+}$]i just
	before onset of the {C}a$^{2+}$ waves ({C}aD) were used to estimate the
	{C}a$^{2+}$ loading of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and the myoplasm,
	respectively. The ratio (Delta{C}aW/Delta{C}aT) of the [{C}a$^{2+}$]i increment
	during the waves (Delta{C}aW) to Delta{C}aT was used to estimate the
	probability of opening of the SR-{C}a$^{2+}$ release channel during
	wave propagation. As a result of an increase of the number of stimuli
	or [{C}a$^{2+}$]o, Vprop increased in proportion to (1) Delta{C}aT (r=0.82);
	(2) {C}aD (r=0.88); (3) Delta{C}aW (r=0.85); and (4) Delta{C}aW/Delta{C}aT
	(r=0.74). The addition of caffeine (</=0.3 mmol/L) increased Vprop
	for any Delta{C}aT and any Delta{C}aW, revealing an increased sensitivity
	of Vprop to Delta{C}aT and Delta{C}aW. In contrast, caffeine had little
	effect on the relationship between Vprop and {C}aD and no effect on
	that between Vprop and Delta{C}aW/Delta{C}aT. These results suggest that
	both the cellular {C}a$^{2+}$ loading and open probability of the SR-{C}a$^{2+}$
	release channels determine the velocity of propagation of {C}a$^{2+}$
	waves.},
