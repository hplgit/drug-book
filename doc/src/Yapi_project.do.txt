Aslak and Glenn have just a published a book about drug modeling. The
manuscript is written in LaTeX, but they want to translate this to
DocOnce such that the book can be produced in responsive HTML formats
for phones and tablets. Parts of the book can than also be translated
to Matlab notebooks.

Start familiarizing yourself a bit with DocOnce by browsing the
tutorial: http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/tutorial/tutorial.html

I have started preparing the .tex files for translation to doconce and
written scripts to deal with some specific constructions that Aslak and
Glenn have in their files. For standard latex commands, I rely on the
command doconce latex2doconce. However, this command fails miserably
already on the second file. The reason is seemingly that there are
many tables that need to be translated first (these tables fool the
latex2doconce translator).

To make progress, we should now

 o Yapi: translate all `\graytable` and standard tables to doconce manually.
   One may experiment with `doconce latex2doconce` for tables that are
   quite standard, but tables are hard to parse, so be prepared for
   manual translation. Basic DocOnce syntax for tables: http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/manual/manual.html#___sec29
 o HP: Find all figures with hbox that need special combination of image
   files with ImageMagick. Manual translation to FIGURE environment.
 o HP: Run `latex2doconce` to see if this is feasible. If not,
   Yapi: translate the rest of the tables.
 o Yapi: Find all tikz figures, copy each of them to a separate file, run
   latex on the file to create a standard image file in PNG and PDF format,
   and make a corresponding FIGURE (doconce) command in the `.do.txt` file.
