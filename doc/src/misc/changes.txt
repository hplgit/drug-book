* figure: use of \hbox and multiple figures, standard caption
* figure references are dir/name, change labels{dir/name} to labels/ref
  dir:name
* figures apply \fig newcommand: 50 begin{figure}, 12 \fig
  must make \fig translation command:
  r'\\fig\[(.+?)\]\{(.+?)\}\{(.+?)\}\n\n' (can have multiple braces in caption
  so we go to end \n\n)
* remove % at end of line
* tikzpicture: must be converted to figure files. 30 such figures! Yapi job?
* tables: look standard, but have captions. About 30 tables.
* {\it ...} must be handled, and \textit{} and {\em ...},
  but the construction under Theoretical drugs should be worked out manually.
* Strange equation references from scientific workplace:
  $\left( \ref{...}\right) .$
  r'\$\\left\( *\\ref\{(.+?)\} *\right).+?\$' -> (ref{\g<1>})

Start with the first .tex file, translate, compile doconce and see that it
is okay. Increment with next .tex file.

Yapi:

Make all figures and tables, \graytable becomes an ordinary table.
Some figures were not well translated by my scripts. All with \winslow
(using tikz) must be translated manually.

Run all tikz pictures in separate files.
\hbox{} alignment of multiple figure files in a figure must be replaced
by running doconce combine_images-style command.
Ref doconce FIGURE and table doc.

The .bib file was huge and very difficult to clean up. publish did not
manage to import everything.
Detect missing references in latex, find them in official.bib,
publish import them.
